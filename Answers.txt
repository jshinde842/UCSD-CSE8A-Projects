1. I predict the result will be exactly the same because the 8ALib.java file primarily introduced a library of commands, however none of those commands are present in PA1.java. My prediction was correct.
2. a) Java first finds the index of (p,",") and then the resulting expression is substring(p,0,indexOf(p,",")).
2. b) Java calculates the length of the string and index numbers as given by the expression (substring(m,0,indexOf(m,",")))
2. c)The entire set of expressions is basically the coordinates of a place and the string "Coordinates: " right before the number.
