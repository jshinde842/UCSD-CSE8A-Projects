Image grayExample1Expect => checker5green.bmp WIDTH = 5, HEIGHT = 5, PIXELS = greenchecker.getPixels(), The image consists of a white and green checkerboard. Once the method grayscale() is used on this image, it will become a white and gray checkerboard.
Image grayExample2Expect => cute_cat_and_dog_3.jpg WIDTH = 1878, HEIGHT = 1774, PIXELS = catDog.getPixels(),Each pixel is grayscaled by the use of the method grayscalePixels() which is included in the method grayscale().

Image complementExample1Expect => checker5green.bmp WIDTH = 5, HEIGHT = 5, PIXELS = greenchecker.getPixels(), The image consists of a white and green checkerboard. Once the method complement() is used on this image, the checkerboard is white and blue because the green is switched out with the blue.
Image complementExample2Expect => cute_cat_and_dog_3.jpg WIDTH = 1878, HEIGHT = 1774, PIXELS = catDog.getPixels(), Once the method complement() is used on this image, each pixel's blue and green values are switched, altering the image's color composition.

Image chromascaleExample1Expect => checker5green.bmp WIDTH = 5, HEIGHT = 5, PIXELS = greenchecker.getPixels(), The image consists of a white and green checkerboard. Once the method chromascale() is used on this image, the checkerboard is black and turquoise because the picture's rgb values are only in shades of turquoise.
Image chromascaleExample2Expect => cute_cat_and_dog_3.jpg WIDTH = 1878, HEIGHT = 1774, PIXELS = catDog.getPixels(), Once the method chromascale() is used on this image, the whole image turns into a shade of violet.

Image gradientExample1Expected => WIDTH = 1000, HEIGHT = 1000, The image created has a gradient squared of the dimensions that goes from blue to white.
Image gradientExample2Expected => WIDTH = 1000, HEIGHT = 1000, The image created has a gradient squared of the dimensions that goes from green to black.

Image chromakeyExample1Expect =>The image created is essentially checker5green because the threshold was not exceeded.
Image chromakeyExample2Expect =>The image created is black and white grid of pixels because the threshold was not exceeded.
3. Open-Ended Questions
Variable table
type / name / value
Color[] / array1 / @A
Color[] / array2 / @B
Color[] / array3 / @A
Heap diagram
reference / value
@A / {new Color(0,0,0), new Color(128, 0, 128), new Color(85, 128, 128)}
@B / {new Color(0,0,255), new Color(85,85,85), new Color(113,113,113)}

A. Black, white or gray. The complement method produces indexes with the same values.
B. Index is not needed because there is no array to begin with, however, weightFor1 is needed in order to scale the gradient.
C. There wouldn't be a Image fg since the Image bg uses every single pixel in the image.
